/*2. PROC SQL*/
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------;
* proc sql allows users to retrieve, summarize, join and sort data;
* is used to (1). generate reports and summary statistics (2). retrieve and combine data from tables
* (3). create tables, views and indexes (4). retrieve data from DBMS ;
/*PROC SQL allows you to combine the functionality of the DATA step and PROC step in a single step*/
